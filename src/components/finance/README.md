# Finance Module Optimization

This document outlines the optimizations made to the Finance module to improve performance, maintainability, and user experience.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. React Query Standardization

- **Centralized Query Keys**: Created a query key factory in `src/lib/query-keys.ts` to ensure consistent query key structure across the application.
- **Standardized Stale Times**: Implemented consistent stale time settings in `src/lib/query-utils.ts` based on data type:
  - `REAL_TIME`: 0ms - Always refetch on mount
  - `FREQUENT`: 1 minute - For frequently changing data
  - `STANDARD`: 5 minutes - Default for most data
  - `STATIC`: 10 minutes - For rarely changing data like categories
  - `VERY_STATIC`: 30 minutes - For very static data

- **Enhanced Query Hooks**: Created `useEnhancedQuery` and `useEnhancedMutation` hooks with built-in performance monitoring.
- **Selective Query Invalidation**: Implemented `invalidateFinanceQueries` utility to selectively invalidate only the necessary queries instead of invalidating all finance queries.

### 2. Component Rendering Optimizations

- **Memoization**: Applied `React.memo()` to components that don't need to re-render frequently:
  - `CategoryCharts`
  - `ErrorDisplay`
  - `DashboardStatsCards`

- **Optimized Suspense Boundaries**: Improved Suspense boundaries for better loading states and user experience.
- **Callback Memoization**: Used `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 3. Data Fetching and Processing

- **Parallel Data Fetching**: Used `Promise.all` to fetch data in parallel in the dashboard hook.
- **Efficient Data Processing**: Optimized data transformation logic using Maps instead of repeated object property access.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added performance monitoring to track and optimize data processing operations.

### 4. Code Splitting and Dynamic Imports

- **Intelligent Prefetching**: Implemented a more intelligent prefetching strategy that:
  - Prefetches adjacent tabs when a tab is selected
  - Staggers prefetching to avoid overwhelming the browser
  - Tracks prefetched tabs to avoid redundant prefetching

- **Optimized Dynamic Imports**: Enhanced dynamic imports with performance monitoring and error handling.
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Each finance section is now loaded only when needed, reducing the initial bundle size.

### 5. Error Handling

- **Improved Error UI**: Enhanced error display with retry functionality.
- **Comprehensive Error Tracking**: Added detailed error tracking with context information.

## File Structure

- `src/lib/query-keys.ts` - Centralized query key factory
- `src/lib/query-utils.ts` - Enhanced React Query utilities
- `src/hooks/use-optimized-finance-dashboard.ts` - Optimized dashboard data hook
- `src/components/finance/finance-dashboard/optimized-dashboard.tsx` - Optimized dashboard component
- `src/components/finance/finance-content.tsx` - Main finance content component with optimized tab handling

## Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring has been added throughout the finance module to track:

- Component load times
- Data fetching durations
- Tab switching performance
- Dynamic import loading times

This data can be used to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

## Future Improvements

1. **Server Components**: Consider converting some components to React Server Components where appropriate.
2. **Data Prefetching**: Implement more sophisticated data prefetching based on user behavior patterns.
3. **Virtualization**: Add virtualization for long lists of transactions to improve rendering performance.
4. **Caching Strategy**: Further refine the caching strategy based on actual usage patterns.
5. **Bundle Analysis**: Regularly analyze bundle sizes to identify opportunities for further optimization.

## Usage Guidelines

When working with the finance module:

1. Always use the centralized query keys from `query-keys.ts`
2. Use the enhanced query hooks for data fetching
3. Apply selective query invalidation instead of invalidating all queries
4. Memoize components and callbacks where appropriate
5. Use the performance monitoring utilities to track performance
